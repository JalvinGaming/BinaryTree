# Binary Tree
a library to do stuff with binary trees i guess

Functions:
- `Node->Invert()` invert binary tree starting at node

Constructors:
- `Node(Node *_left, Node *_right, int _data)` make a node with left and right as children (yes they can be nullptr)

this library is very unfinished, but the functions work reliably, there are just very few of them because i have 0 ideas
